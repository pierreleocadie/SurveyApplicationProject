"""
This is the `dao` package. It contains several Data Access Objects (DAOs) that provide an abstract interface to 
the database. Each DAO provides specific operations without exposing details of the database.

Available sub-modules:
- AdminDAO: for admin-related database operations.
- ApiKeyDAO: for API key-related database operations.
- ConstituentDAO: for constituent-related database operations.
- FoodDAO: for food-related database operations.
- StatsDAO: for statistics-related database operations.
- SurveyDAO: for survey-related database operations.
